# TDD Dev Story Workflow

## Purpose

Implements user stories using strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology, ensuring every line of production code is justified by a failing test that validates acceptance criteria.

## Methodology

RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle:

- **RED**: Write a failing test that describes desired behavior
- **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
- **REFACTOR**: Improve code design while keeping tests green

## Key Features

- Test-first development approach
- Automatic RVTM traceability integration
- Continuous validation through test execution
- Coverage tracking and reporting
- Acceptance criteria-driven testing

## When to Use

- Implementing approved user stories
- Building new features from scratch
- Refactoring with confidence
- Ensuring high code quality
- Meeting coverage requirements

## Prerequisites

- Story in "Approved" status
- Story Context JSON/XML available
- Test framework configured
- Development environment ready

## Workflow Steps

1. Load and validate story context
2. Extract tasks from acceptance criteria
3. Execute TDD cycles for each task
4. Validate complete implementation
5. Update story and RVTM traceability

## Benefits

- **Quality**: Bugs caught early through test-first approach
- **Design**: Tests drive better API design
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation
- **Confidence**: Refactoring without fear of breaking
- **Traceability**: Automatic requirement-test-code linking

## Integration Points

- Story Context (JSON/XML)
- RVTM traceability matrix
- Test frameworks (pytest, jest, etc.)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Coverage reporting tools

## Success Metrics

- 100% of ACs have tests
- 0 failing tests
- 80%+ code coverage
- All RVTM links established
- Story marked "Implemented"
