# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .tdd-methodology/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .tdd-methodology/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.tdd-methodology/personas/analyst.md`, `.tdd-methodology/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` → Look for `==================== START: .tdd-methodology/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` → Look for `==================== START: .tdd-methodology/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# Story Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist

## Instructions for Developer Agent

Before marking a story as 'Review', please go through each item in this checklist. Report the status of each item (e.g., [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, [N/A] Not Applicable) and provide brief comments if necessary.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - STORY DOD VALIDATION

This checklist is for DEVELOPER AGENTS to self-validate their work before marking a story complete.

IMPORTANT: This is a self-assessment. Be honest about what's actually done vs what should be done. It's better to identify issues now than have them found in review.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
4. Be specific about what was actually implemented
5. Flag any concerns or technical debt created

The goal is quality delivery, not just checking boxes.]]

## Checklist Items

1. **Requirements Met:**

   [[LLM: Be specific - list each requirement and whether it's complete]]
   - [ ] All functional requirements specified in the story are implemented.
   - [ ] All acceptance criteria defined in the story are met.

   - [ ] All required integration tests (if applicable) as per the story and `Operational Guidelines` Testing Strategy are implemented.
   - [ ] All tests (unit, integration, E2E if applicable) pass successfully.
   - [ ] Test coverage meets project standards (if defined).

4. **Functionality & Verification:**

   [[LLM: Did you actually run and test your code? Be specific about what you tested]]
   - [ ] Functionality has been manually verified by the developer (e.g., running the app locally, checking UI, testing API endpoints).
   - [ ] Edge cases and potential error conditions considered and handled gracefully.

5. **Story Administration:**

   [[LLM: Documentation helps the next developer. What should they know?]]
   - [ ] All tasks within the story file are marked as complete.
   - [ ] Any clarifications or decisions made during development are documented in the story file or linked appropriately.
   - [ ] The story wrap up section has been completed with notes of changes or information relevant to the next story or overall project, the agent model that was primarily used during development, and the changelog of any changes is properly updated.

6. **Dependencies, Build & Configuration:**

   [[LLM: Build issues block everyone. Ensure everything compiles and runs cleanly]]
   - [ ] Project builds successfully without errors.
   - [ ] Project linting passes
   - [ ] Any new dependencies added were either pre-approved in the story requirements OR explicitly approved by the user during development (approval documented in story file).
   - [ ] If new dependencies were added, they are recorded in the appropriate project files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`) with justification.
   - [ ] No known security vulnerabilities introduced by newly added and approved dependencies.
   - [ ] If new environment variables or configurations were introduced by the story, they are documented and handled securely.

7. **Documentation (If Applicable):**

   [[LLM: Good documentation prevents future confusion. What needs explaining?]]
   - [ ] Relevant inline code documentation (e.g., JSDoc, TSDoc, Python docstrings) for new public APIs or complex logic is complete.
   - [ ] User-facing documentation updated, if changes impact users.
   - [ ] Technical documentation (e.g., READMEs, system diagrams) updated if significant architectural changes were made.

## Final Confirmation

[[LLM: FINAL DOD SUMMARY

After completing the checklist:

1. Summarize what was accomplished in this story
2. List any items marked as [ ] Not Done with explanations
3. Identify any technical debt or follow-up work needed
4. Note any challenges or learnings for future stories
5. Confirm whether the story is truly ready for review

Be honest - it's better to flag issues now than have them discovered later.]]

- [ ] I, the Developer Agent, confirm that all applicable items above have been addressed.

# apply-qa-fixes

Implement fixes based on QA results (gate and assessments) for a specific story. This task is for the Dev agent to systematically consume QA outputs and apply code/test changes while only updating allowed sections in the story file.

## Purpose

- Read QA outputs for a story (gate YAML + assessment markdowns)
- Create a prioritized, deterministic fix plan
- Apply code and test changes to close gaps and address issues
- Update only the allowed story sections for the Dev agent

## Inputs

```yaml
required:
  - story_id: '{epic}.{story}' # e.g., "2.2"
  - qa_root: from `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` key `qa.qaLocation` (e.g., `docs/project/qa`)
  - story_root: from `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` key `devStoryLocation` (e.g., `docs/project/stories`)

optional:
  - story_title: '{title}' # derive from story H1 if missing
  - story_slug: '{slug}' # derive from title (lowercase, hyphenated) if missing
```

## QA Sources to Read

- Gate (YAML): `{qa_root}/gates/{epic}.{story}-*.yml`
  - If multiple, use the most recent by modified time
- Assessments (Markdown):
  - Test Design: `{qa_root}/assessments/{epic}.{story}-test-design-*.md`
  - Traceability: `{qa_root}/assessments/{epic}.{story}-trace-*.md`
  - Risk Profile: `{qa_root}/assessments/{epic}.{story}-risk-*.md`
  - NFR Assessment: `{qa_root}/assessments/{epic}.{story}-nfr-*.md`

## Prerequisites

- Repository builds and tests run locally (Deno 2)
- Lint and test commands available:
  - `deno lint`
  - `deno test -A`

## Process (Do not skip steps)

### 0) Load Core Config & Locate Story

- Read `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` and resolve `qa_root` and `story_root`
- Locate story file in `{story_root}/{epic}.{story}.*.md`
  - HALT if missing and ask for correct story id/path

### 1) Collect QA Findings

- Parse the latest gate YAML:
  - `gate` (PASS|CONCERNS|FAIL|WAIVED)
  - `top_issues[]` with `id`, `severity`, `finding`, `suggested_action`
  - `nfr_validation.*.status` and notes
  - `trace` coverage summary/gaps
  - `test_design.coverage_gaps[]`
  - `risk_summary.recommendations.must_fix[]` (if present)
- Read any present assessment markdowns and extract explicit gaps/recommendations

### 2) Build Deterministic Fix Plan (Priority Order)

Apply in order, highest priority first:

1. High severity items in `top_issues` (security/perf/reliability/maintainability)
2. NFR statuses: all FAIL must be fixed → then CONCERNS
3. Test Design `coverage_gaps` (prioritize P0 scenarios if specified)
4. Trace uncovered requirements (AC-level)
5. Risk `must_fix` recommendations
6. Medium severity issues, then low

Guidance:

- Prefer tests closing coverage gaps before/with code changes
- Keep changes minimal and targeted; follow project architecture and TS/Deno rules

### 3) Apply Changes

- Implement code fixes per plan
- Add missing tests to close coverage gaps (unit first; integration where required by AC)
- Keep imports centralized via `deps.ts` (see `docs/project/typescript-rules.md`)
- Follow DI boundaries in `src/core/di.ts` and existing patterns

### 4) Validate

- Run `deno lint` and fix issues
- Run `deno test -A` until all tests pass
- Iterate until clean

### 5) Update Story (Allowed Sections ONLY)

CRITICAL: Dev agent is ONLY authorized to update these sections of the story file. Do not modify any other sections (e.g., QA Results, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Dev Notes, Testing):

- Tasks / Subtasks Checkboxes (mark any fix subtask you added as done)
- Dev Agent Record →
  - Agent Model Used (if changed)
  - Debug Log References (commands/results, e.g., lint/tests)
  - Completion Notes List (what changed, why, how)
  - File List (all added/modified/deleted files)
- Change Log (new dated entry describing applied fixes)
- Status (see Rule below)

Status Rule:

- If gate was PASS and all identified gaps are closed → set `Status: Ready for Done`
- Otherwise → set `Status: Ready for Review` and notify QA to re-run the review

### 6) Do NOT Edit Gate Files

- Dev does not modify gate YAML. If fixes address issues, request QA to re-run `review-story` to update the gate

## Blocking Conditions

- Missing `bmad-core/core-config.yaml`
- Story file not found for `story_id`
- No QA artifacts found (neither gate nor assessments)
  - HALT and request QA to generate at least a gate file (or proceed only with clear developer-provided fix list)

## Completion Checklist

- deno lint: 0 problems
- deno test -A: all tests pass
- All high severity `top_issues` addressed
- NFR FAIL → resolved; CONCERNS minimized or documented
- Coverage gaps closed or explicitly documented with rationale
- Story updated (allowed sections only) including File List and Change Log
- Status set according to Status Rule

## Example: Story 2.2

Given gate `docs/project/qa/gates/2.2-*.yml` shows

- `coverage_gaps`: Back action behavior untested (AC2)
- `coverage_gaps`: Centralized dependencies enforcement untested (AC4)

Fix plan:

- Add a test ensuring the Toolkit Menu "Back" action returns to Main Menu
- Add a static test verifying imports for service/view go through `deps.ts`
- Re-run lint/tests and update Dev Agent Record + File List accordingly

## Key Principles

- Deterministic, risk-first prioritization
- Minimal, maintainable changes
- Tests validate behavior and close gaps
- Strict adherence to allowed story update areas
- Gate ownership remains with QA; Dev signals readiness via Status

# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the .tdd-methodology/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from .tdd-methodology/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**
   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:
   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:
   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:
   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ✅ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ❌ FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ⚠️ PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:
   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:
   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures

# Validate Next Story Task

## Purpose

To comprehensively validate a story draft before implementation begins, ensuring it is complete, accurate, and provides sufficient context for successful development. This task identifies issues and gaps that need to be addressed, preventing hallucinations and ensuring implementation readiness.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 0. Load Core Configuration and Inputs

- Load `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`
- If the file does not exist, HALT and inform the user: "core-config.yaml not found. This file is required for story validation."
- Extract key configurations: `devStoryLocation`, `prd.*`, `architecture.*`
- Identify and load the following inputs:
  - **Story file**: The drafted story to validate (provided by user or discovered in `devStoryLocation`)
  - **Parent epic**: The epic containing this story's requirements
  - **Architecture documents**: Based on configuration (sharded or monolithic)
  - **Story template**: `bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.md` for completeness validation

### 1. Template Completeness Validation

- Load `bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.md` and extract all section headings from the template
- **Missing sections check**: Compare story sections against template sections to verify all required sections are present
- **Placeholder validation**: Ensure no template placeholders remain unfilled (e.g., `{{EpicNum}}`, `{{role}}`, `_TBD_`)
- **Agent section verification**: Confirm all sections from template exist for future agent use
- **Structure compliance**: Verify story follows template structure and formatting

### 2. File Structure and Source Tree Validation

- **File paths clarity**: Are new/existing files to be created/modified clearly specified?
- **Source tree relevance**: Is relevant project structure included in Dev Notes?
- **Directory structure**: Are new directories/components properly located according to project structure?
- **File creation sequence**: Do tasks specify where files should be created in logical order?
- **Path accuracy**: Are file paths consistent with project structure from architecture docs?

### 3. UI/Frontend Completeness Validation (if applicable)

- **Component specifications**: Are UI components sufficiently detailed for implementation?
- **Styling/design guidance**: Is visual implementation guidance clear?
- **User interaction flows**: Are UX patterns and behaviors specified?
- **Responsive/accessibility**: Are these considerations addressed if required?
- **Integration points**: Are frontend-backend integration points clear?

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Satisfaction Assessment

- **AC coverage**: Will all acceptance criteria be satisfied by the listed tasks?
- **AC testability**: Are acceptance criteria measurable and verifiable?
- **Missing scenarios**: Are edge cases or error conditions covered?
- **Success definition**: Is "done" clearly defined for each AC?
- **Task-AC mapping**: Are tasks properly linked to specific acceptance criteria?

### 5. Validation and Testing Instructions Review

- **Test approach clarity**: Are testing methods clearly specified?
- **Test scenarios**: Are key test cases identified?
- **Validation steps**: Are acceptance criteria validation steps clear?
- **Testing tools/frameworks**: Are required testing tools specified?
- **Test data requirements**: Are test data needs identified?

### 6. Security Considerations Assessment (if applicable)

- **Security requirements**: Are security needs identified and addressed?
- **Authentication/authorization**: Are access controls specified?
- **Data protection**: Are sensitive data handling requirements clear?
- **Vulnerability prevention**: Are common security issues addressed?
- **Compliance requirements**: Are regulatory/compliance needs addressed?

### 7. Tasks/Subtasks Sequence Validation

- **Logical order**: Do tasks follow proper implementation sequence?
- **Dependencies**: Are task dependencies clear and correct?
- **Granularity**: Are tasks appropriately sized and actionable?
- **Completeness**: Do tasks cover all requirements and acceptance criteria?
- **Blocking issues**: Are there any tasks that would block others?

### 8. Anti-Hallucination Verification

- **Source verification**: Every technical claim must be traceable to source documents
- **Architecture alignment**: Dev Notes content matches architecture specifications
- **No invented details**: Flag any technical decisions not supported by source documents
- **Reference accuracy**: Verify all source references are correct and accessible
- **Fact checking**: Cross-reference claims against epic and architecture documents

### 9. Dev Agent Implementation Readiness

- **Self-contained context**: Can the story be implemented without reading external docs?
- **Clear instructions**: Are implementation steps unambiguous?
- **Complete technical context**: Are all required technical details present in Dev Notes?
- **Missing information**: Identify any critical information gaps
- **Actionability**: Are all tasks actionable by a development agent?

### 10. Generate Validation Report

Provide a structured validation report including:

#### Template Compliance Issues

- Missing sections from story template
- Unfilled placeholders or template variables
- Structural formatting issues

#### Critical Issues (Must Fix - Story Blocked)

- Missing essential information for implementation
- Inaccurate or unverifiable technical claims
- Incomplete acceptance criteria coverage
- Missing required sections

#### Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)

- Unclear implementation guidance
- Missing security considerations
- Task sequencing problems
- Incomplete testing instructions

#### Nice-to-Have Improvements (Optional Enhancements)

- Additional context that would help implementation
- Clarifications that would improve efficiency
- Documentation improvements

#### Anti-Hallucination Findings

- Unverifiable technical claims
- Missing source references
- Inconsistencies with architecture documents
- Invented libraries, patterns, or standards

#### Final Assessment

- **GO**: Story is ready for implementation
- **NO-GO**: Story requires fixes before implementation
- **Implementation Readiness Score**: 1-10 scale
- **Confidence Level**: High/Medium/Low for successful implementation

# tdd-implement

Implement minimal code to make failing tests pass - the "Green" phase of TDD.

## Purpose

Write the simplest possible implementation that makes all failing tests pass. This is the "Green" phase of TDD where we focus on making tests pass with minimal, clean code.

## Prerequisites

- Story has failing tests (tdd.status: red)
- All tests fail for correct reasons (missing implementation, not bugs)
- Test runner is configured and working
- Dev agent has reviewed failing tests and acceptance criteria

## Inputs

```yaml
required:
  - story_id: '{epic}.{story}' # e.g., "1.3"
  - story_path: '{devStoryLocation}/{epic}.{story}.*.md' # Path from core-config.yaml
  - failing_tests: # List from story TDD metadata
      - id: test identifier
      - file_path: path to test file
      - status: failing
```

## Process

### 1. Review Failing Tests

Before writing any code:

- Read each failing test to understand expected behavior
- Identify the interfaces/classes/functions that need to be created
- Note expected inputs, outputs, and error conditions
- Understand the test's mocking strategy

### 2. Design Minimal Implementation

**TDD Green Phase Principles:**

- **Make it work first, then make it right**
- **Simplest thing that could possibly work**
- **No feature without a failing test**
- **Avoid premature abstraction**
- **Prefer duplication over wrong abstraction**

### 3. Implement Code

**Implementation Strategy:**

```yaml
approach: 1. Start with simplest happy path test
  2. Write minimal code to pass that test
  3. Run tests frequently (after each small change)
  4. Move to next failing test
  5. Repeat until all tests pass

avoid:
  - Adding features not covered by tests
  - Complex algorithms when simple ones suffice
  - Premature optimization
  - Over-engineering the solution
```

**Example Implementation Progression:**

```javascript
// First test: should return user with id
// Minimal implementation:
function createUser(userData) {
  return { id: 1, ...userData };
}

// Second test: should validate email format
// Expand implementation:
function createUser(userData) {
  if (!userData.email.includes('@')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email format');
  }
  return { id: 1, ...userData };
}
```

### 4. Run Tests Continuously

**Test-Driven Workflow:**

1. Run specific failing test
2. Write minimal code to make it pass
3. Run that test again to confirm green
4. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
5. Move to next failing test

**Test Execution Commands:**

```bash
# Run specific test file
npm test -- user-service.test.js
pytest tests/unit/test_user_service.py
go test ./services/user_test.go

# Run full test suite
npm test
pytest
go test ./...
```

### 5. Handle Edge Cases

Implement only edge cases that have corresponding tests:

- Input validation as tested
- Error conditions as specified in tests
- Boundary conditions covered by tests
- Nothing more, nothing less

### 6. Maintain Test-Code Traceability

**Commit Strategy:**

```bash
git add tests/ src/
git commit -m "GREEN: Implement user creation [UC-001, UC-002]"
```

Link implementation to specific test IDs in commits for traceability.

### 7. Update Story Metadata

Update TDD status to green:

```yaml
tdd:
  status: green
  cycle: 1
  tests:
    - id: 'UC-001'
      name: 'should create user with valid email'
      type: unit
      status: passing
      file_path: 'tests/unit/user-service.test.js'
    - id: 'UC-002'
      name: 'should reject user with invalid email'
      type: unit
      status: passing
      file_path: 'tests/unit/user-service.test.js'
```

## Output Requirements

### 1. Working Implementation

Create source files that:

- Make all failing tests pass
- Follow project coding standards
- Are minimal and focused
- Have clear, intention-revealing names

### 2. Test Execution Report

```bash
Running tests...
✅ UserService > should create user with valid email
✅ UserService > should reject user with invalid email

2 passing, 0 failing
```

### 3. Story File Updates

Append to TDD section:

```markdown
## TDD Progress

### Green Phase - Cycle 1

**Date:** {current_date}
**Agent:** James (Dev Agent)

**Implementation Summary:**

- Created UserService class with create() method
- Added email validation for @ symbol
- All tests now passing ✅

**Files Modified:**

- src/services/user-service.js (created)

**Test Results:**

- UC-001: should create user with valid email (PASSING ✅)
- UC-002: should reject user with invalid email (PASSING ✅)

**Next Step:** Review implementation for refactoring opportunities
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

**During Green Phase:**

- **Readable:** Clear variable and function names
- **Simple:** Avoid complex logic when simple works
- **Testable:** Code structure supports the tests
- **Focused:** Each function has single responsibility

**Acceptable Technical Debt (to be addressed in Refactor phase):**

- Code duplication if it keeps tests green
- Hardcoded values if they make tests pass
- Simple algorithms even if inefficient
- Minimal error handling beyond what tests require

### Common Patterns

**Factory Functions:**

```javascript
function createUser(data) {
  // Minimal validation
  return { id: generateId(), ...data };
}
```

**Error Handling:**

```javascript
function validateEmail(email) {
  if (!email.includes('@')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email');
  }
}
```

**State Management:**

```javascript
class UserService {
  constructor(database) {
    this.db = database; // Accept injected dependency
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

**If tests still fail after implementation:**

- Review test expectations vs actual implementation
- Check for typos in function/method names
- Verify correct imports/exports
- Ensure proper handling of async operations

**If tests pass unexpectedly without changes:**

- Implementation might already exist
- Test might be incorrect
- Review git status for unexpected changes

**If new tests start failing:**

- Implementation may have broken existing functionality
- Review change impact
- Fix regressions before continuing

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Feature Creep:**

- Don't implement features without failing tests
- Don't add "obviously needed" functionality

**Premature Optimization:**

- Don't optimize for performance in green phase
- Focus on correctness first

**Over-Engineering:**

- Don't add abstraction layers without tests requiring them
- Avoid complex design patterns in initial implementation

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] All previously failing tests now pass
- [ ] No existing tests broken (regression check)
- [ ] Implementation is minimal and focused
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Story TDD status updated to 'green'
- [ ] Files properly committed with test traceability
- [ ] Ready for refactor phase assessment

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Verify all tests pass
npm test
pytest
go test ./...
mvn test
dotnet test

# Check code quality (basic)
npm run lint
flake8 .
golint ./...
```

## Key Principles

- **Make it work:** Green tests are the only measure of success
- **Keep it simple:** Resist urge to make it elegant yet
- **One test at a time:** Focus on single failing test
- **Fast feedback:** Run tests frequently during development
- **No speculation:** Only implement what tests require

# tdd-refactor

Safely refactor code while keeping all tests green - the "Refactor" phase of TDD.

## Purpose

Improve code quality, eliminate duplication, and enhance design while maintaining all existing functionality. This is the "Refactor" phase of TDD where we make the code clean and maintainable.

## Prerequisites

- All tests are passing (tdd.status: green)
- Implementation is complete and functional
- Test suite provides safety net for refactoring
- Code follows basic project standards

## Inputs

```yaml
required:
  - story_id: '{epic}.{story}' # e.g., "1.3"
  - story_path: '{devStoryLocation}/{epic}.{story}.*.md' # Path from core-config.yaml
  - passing_tests: # All tests should be green
      - id: test identifier
      - status: passing
  - implementation_files: # Source files to potentially refactor
      - path: file path
      - purpose: what it does
```

## Process

### 1. Identify Refactoring Opportunities

**Code Smells to Look For:**

```yaml
common_smells:
  duplication:
    - Repeated code blocks
    - Similar logic in different places
    - Copy-paste patterns

  complexity:
    - Long methods/functions (>10-15 lines)
    - Too many parameters (>3-4)
    - Nested conditions (>2-3 levels)
    - Complex boolean expressions

  naming:
    - Unclear variable names
    - Non-descriptive function names
    - Inconsistent naming conventions

  structure:
    - God objects/classes doing too much
    - Primitive obsession
    - Feature envy (method using more from other class)
    - Long parameter lists
```

### 2. Plan Refactoring Steps

**Refactoring Strategy:**

- **One change at a time:** Make small, atomic improvements
- **Run tests after each change:** Ensure no functionality breaks
- **Commit frequently:** Create checkpoints for easy rollback
- **Improve design:** Move toward better architecture

**Common Refactoring Techniques:**

```yaml
extract_methods:
  when: 'Function is too long or doing multiple things'
  technique: 'Extract complex logic into named methods'

rename_variables:
  when: "Names don't clearly express intent"
  technique: 'Use intention-revealing names'

eliminate_duplication:
  when: 'Same code appears in multiple places'
  technique: 'Extract to shared function/method'

simplify_conditionals:
  when: 'Complex boolean logic is hard to understand'
  technique: 'Extract to well-named boolean methods'

introduce_constants:
  when: 'Magic numbers or strings appear repeatedly'
  technique: 'Create named constants'
```

### 3. Execute Refactoring

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Choose smallest improvement**
2. **Make the change**
3. **Run all tests**
4. **Commit if green**
5. **Repeat**

**Example Refactoring Sequence:**

```javascript
// Before refactoring
function createUser(data) {
  if (!data.email.includes('@') || data.email.length < 5) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email format');
  }
  if (!data.name || data.name.trim().length === 0) {
    throw new Error('Name is required');
  }
  return {
    id: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000),
    ...data,
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  };
}

// After refactoring - Step 1: Extract validation
function validateEmail(email) {
  return email.includes('@') && email.length >= 5;
}

function validateName(name) {
  return name && name.trim().length > 0;
}

function createUser(data) {
  if (!validateEmail(data.email)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email format');
  }
  if (!validateName(data.name)) {
    throw new Error('Name is required');
  }
  return {
    id: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000),
    ...data,
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  };
}

// After refactoring - Step 2: Extract ID generation
function generateUserId() {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000);
}

function createUser(data) {
  if (!validateEmail(data.email)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email format');
  }
  if (!validateName(data.name)) {
    throw new Error('Name is required');
  }
  return {
    id: generateUserId(),
    ...data,
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  };
}
```

### 4. Test After Each Change

**Critical Rule:** Never proceed without green tests

```bash
# Run tests after each refactoring step
npm test
pytest
go test ./...

# If tests fail:
# 1. Undo the change
# 2. Understand what broke
# 3. Try smaller refactoring
# 4. Fix tests if they need updating (rare)
```

### 5. Collaborate with QA Agent

**When to involve QA:**

- Tests need updating due to interface changes
- New test cases identified during refactoring
- Questions about test coverage adequacy
- Validation of refactoring safety

### 6. Update Story Documentation

Track refactoring progress:

```yaml
tdd:
  status: refactor # or done if complete
  cycle: 1
  refactoring_notes:
    - extracted_methods: ['validateEmail', 'validateName', 'generateUserId']
    - eliminated_duplication: 'Email validation logic'
    - improved_readability: 'Function names now express intent'
```

## Output Requirements

### 1. Improved Code Quality

**Measurable Improvements:**

- Reduced code duplication
- Clearer naming and structure
- Smaller, focused functions
- Better separation of concerns

### 2. Maintained Test Coverage

```bash
# All tests still passing
✅ UserService > should create user with valid email
✅ UserService > should reject user with invalid email
✅ UserService > should require valid name

3 passing, 0 failing
```

### 3. Story File Updates

Append to TDD section:

```markdown
## TDD Progress

### Refactor Phase - Cycle 1

**Date:** {current_date}
**Agents:** James (Dev) & Quinn (QA)

**Refactoring Completed:**

- ✅ Extracted validation functions for better readability
- ✅ Eliminated duplicate email validation logic
- ✅ Introduced generateUserId() for testability
- ✅ Simplified createUser() main logic

**Code Quality Improvements:**

- Function length reduced from 12 to 6 lines
- Three reusable validation functions created
- Magic numbers eliminated
- Test coverage maintained at 100%

**Files Modified:**

- src/services/user-service.js (refactored)

**All Tests Passing:** ✅

**Next Step:** Story ready for review or next TDD cycle
```

## Refactoring Guidelines

### Safe Refactoring Practices

**Always Safe:**

- Rename variables/functions
- Extract methods
- Inline temporary variables
- Replace magic numbers with constants

**Potentially Risky:**

- Changing method signatures
- Modifying class hierarchies
- Altering error handling
- Changing async/sync behavior

**Never Do During Refactor:**

- Add new features
- Change external behavior
- Remove existing functionality
- Skip running tests

### Code Quality Metrics

**Before/After Comparison:**

```yaml
metrics_to_track:
  cyclomatic_complexity: 'Lower is better'
  function_length: 'Shorter is generally better'
  duplication_percentage: 'Should decrease'
  test_coverage: 'Should maintain 100%'

acceptable_ranges:
  function_length: '5-15 lines for most functions'
  parameters: '0-4 parameters per function'
  nesting_depth: 'Maximum 3 levels'
```

## Advanced Refactoring Techniques

### Design Pattern Introduction

**When appropriate:**

- Template Method for algorithmic variations
- Strategy Pattern for behavior selection
- Factory Pattern for object creation
- Observer Pattern for event handling

**Caution:** Only introduce patterns if they simplify the code

### Architecture Improvements

```yaml
layering:
  - Separate business logic from presentation
  - Extract data access concerns
  - Isolate external dependencies

dependency_injection:
  - Make dependencies explicit
  - Enable easier testing
  - Improve modularity

error_handling:
  - Consistent error types
  - Meaningful error messages
  - Proper error propagation
```

## Error Handling

**If tests fail during refactoring:**

1. **Undo immediately** - Use git to revert
2. **Analyze the failure** - What assumption was wrong?
3. **Try smaller steps** - More atomic refactoring
4. **Consider test updates** - Only if interface must change

**If code becomes more complex:**

- Refactoring went wrong direction
- Revert and try different approach
- Consider if change is actually needed

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] All identified code smells addressed or documented
- [ ] All tests remain green throughout process
- [ ] Code is more readable and maintainable
- [ ] No new functionality added during refactoring
- [ ] Story TDD status updated appropriately
- [ ] Refactoring changes committed with clear messages
- [ ] Code quality metrics improved or maintained
- [ ] Ready for story completion or next TDD cycle

## Key Principles

- **Green Bar:** Never proceed with failing tests
- **Small Steps:** Make incremental improvements
- **Behavior Preservation:** External behavior must remain identical
- **Frequent Commits:** Create rollback points
- **Test First:** Let tests guide refactoring safety
- **Collaborative:** Work with QA when test updates needed

# TDD Green Phase Prompts

Instructions for Dev agents when implementing minimal code to make tests pass in Test-Driven Development.

## Core Green Phase Mindset

**You are a Dev Agent in TDD GREEN PHASE. Your mission is to write the SIMPLEST code that makes all failing tests pass. Resist the urge to be clever - be minimal.**

### Primary Objectives

1. **Make it work first** - Focus on making tests pass, not perfect design
2. **Minimal implementation** - Write only what's needed for green tests
3. **No feature creep** - Don't add functionality without failing tests
4. **Fast feedback** - Run tests frequently during implementation
5. **Traceability** - Link implementation directly to test requirements

## Implementation Strategy

### The Three Rules of TDD (Uncle Bob)

1. **Don't write production code** unless it makes a failing test pass
2. **Don't write more test code** than necessary to demonstrate failure (QA phase)
3. **Don't write more production code** than necessary to make failing tests pass

### Green Phase Workflow

```yaml
workflow:
  1. read_failing_test: 'Understand what the test expects'
  2. write_minimal_code: 'Simplest implementation to pass'
  3. run_test: 'Verify this specific test passes'
  4. run_all_tests: 'Ensure no regressions'
  5. repeat: 'Move to next failing test'

never_skip:
  - running_tests_after_each_change
  - checking_for_regressions
  - committing_when_green
```

### Minimal Implementation Examples

**Example 1: Start with Hardcoded Values**

```javascript
// Test expects:
it('should return user with ID when creating user', () => {
  const result = userService.createUser({ name: 'Test' });
  expect(result).toEqual({ id: 1, name: 'Test' });
});

// Minimal implementation (hardcode first):
function createUser(userData) {
  return { id: 1, name: userData.name };
}

// Test expects different ID:
it('should return different ID for second user', () => {
  userService.createUser({ name: 'First' });
  const result = userService.createUser({ name: 'Second' });
  expect(result.id).toBe(2);
});

// Now make it dynamic:
let nextId = 1;
function createUser(userData) {
  return { id: nextId++, name: userData.name };
}
```

**Example 2: Validation Implementation**

```javascript
// Test expects validation error:
it('should throw error when email is invalid', () => {
  expect(() => createUser({ email: 'invalid' })).toThrow('Invalid email format');
});

// Minimal validation:
function createUser(userData) {
  if (!userData.email.includes('@')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email format');
  }
  return { id: nextId++, ...userData };
}
```

## Avoiding Feature Creep

### What NOT to Add (Yet)

```javascript
// Don't add these without failing tests:

// ❌ Comprehensive validation
function createUser(data) {
  if (!data.email || !data.email.includes('@')) throw new Error('Invalid email');
  if (!data.name || data.name.trim().length === 0) throw new Error('Name required');
  if (data.age && (data.age < 0 || data.age > 150)) throw new Error('Invalid age');
  // ... only add validation that has failing tests
}

// ❌ Performance optimizations
function createUser(data) {
  // Don't add caching, connection pooling, etc. without tests
}

// ❌ Future features
function createUser(data) {
  // Don't add roles, permissions, etc. unless tests require it
}
```

### What TO Add

```javascript
// ✅ Only what tests require:
function createUser(data) {
  // Only validate what failing tests specify
  if (!data.email.includes('@')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email format');
  }

  // Only return what tests expect
  return { id: generateId(), ...data };
}
```

## Test-Code Traceability

### Linking Implementation to Tests

```javascript
// Test ID: UC-001
it('should create user with valid email', () => {
  const result = createUser({ email: 'test@example.com', name: 'Test' });
  expect(result).toHaveProperty('id');
});

// Implementation comment linking to test:
function createUser(data) {
  // UC-001: Return user with generated ID
  return {
    id: generateId(),
    ...data,
  };
}
```

### Commit Messages with Test References

```bash
# Good commit messages:
git commit -m "GREEN: Implement user creation [UC-001, UC-002]"
git commit -m "GREEN: Add email validation for createUser [UC-003]"
git commit -m "GREEN: Handle edge case for empty name [UC-004]"

# Avoid vague messages:
git commit -m "Fixed user service"
git commit -m "Added validation"
```

## Handling Different Test Types

### Unit Tests - Pure Logic

```javascript
// Test: Calculate tax for purchase
it('should calculate 10% tax on purchase amount', () => {
  expect(calculateTax(100)).toBe(10);
});

// Minimal implementation:
function calculateTax(amount) {
  return amount * 0.1;
}
```

### Integration Tests - Component Interaction

```javascript
// Test: Service uses injected database
it('should save user to database when created', async () => {
  const mockDb = { save: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: 1 }) };
  const service = new UserService(mockDb);

  await service.createUser({ name: 'Test' });

  expect(mockDb.save).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ name: 'Test' });
});

// Minimal implementation:
class UserService {
  constructor(database) {
    this.db = database;
  }

  async createUser(userData) {
    return await this.db.save(userData);
  }
}
```

### Error Handling Tests

```javascript
// Test: Handle database connection failure
it('should throw service error when database is unavailable', async () => {
  const mockDb = { save: jest.fn().mockRejectedValue(new Error('DB down')) };
  const service = new UserService(mockDb);

  await expect(service.createUser({ name: 'Test' }))
    .rejects.toThrow('Service temporarily unavailable');
});

// Minimal error handling:
async createUser(userData) {
  try {
    return await this.db.save(userData);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error('Service temporarily unavailable');
  }
}
```

## Fast Feedback Loop

### Test Execution Strategy

```bash
# Run single test file while implementing:
npm test -- user-service.test.js --watch
pytest tests/unit/test_user_service.py -v
go test ./services -run TestUserService

# Run full suite after each feature:
npm test
pytest
go test ./...
```

### IDE Integration

```yaml
recommended_setup:
  - test_runner_integration: 'Tests run on save'
  - live_feedback: 'Immediate pass/fail indicators'
  - coverage_display: 'Show which lines are tested'
  - failure_details: 'Quick access to error messages'
```

## Common Green Phase Mistakes

### Mistake: Over-Implementation

```javascript
// Wrong: Adding features without tests
function createUser(data) {
  // No test requires password hashing yet
  const hashedPassword = hashPassword(data.password);

  // No test requires audit logging yet
  auditLog.record('user_created', data);

  // Only implement what tests require
  return { id: generateId(), ...data };
}
```

### Mistake: Premature Abstraction

```javascript
// Wrong: Creating abstractions too early
class UserValidatorFactory {
  static createValidator(type) {
    // Complex factory pattern without tests requiring it
  }
}

// Right: Keep it simple until tests demand complexity
function createUser(data) {
  if (!data.email.includes('@')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email');
  }
  return { id: generateId(), ...data };
}
```

### Mistake: Not Running Tests Frequently

```javascript
// Wrong: Writing lots of code before testing
function createUser(data) {
  // 20 lines of code without running tests
  // Many assumptions about what tests expect
}

// Right: Small changes, frequent test runs
function createUser(data) {
  return { id: 1, ...data }; // Run test - passes
}

// Then add next failing test's requirement:
function createUser(data) {
  if (!data.email.includes('@')) throw new Error('Invalid email');
  return { id: 1, ...data }; // Run test - passes
}
```

## Quality Standards in Green Phase

### Acceptable Technical Debt

```javascript
// OK during Green phase (will fix in Refactor):
function createUser(data) {
  // Hardcoded values
  const id = 1;

  // Duplicated validation logic
  if (!data.email.includes('@')) throw new Error('Invalid email');
  if (!data.name || data.name.trim() === '') throw new Error('Name required');

  // Simple algorithm even if inefficient
  return { id: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000), ...data };
}
```

### Minimum Standards (Even in Green)

```javascript
// Always maintain:
function createUser(data) {
  // Clear variable names
  const userData = { ...data };
  const userId = generateId();

  // Proper error messages
  if (!userData.email.includes('@')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email format');
  }

  // Return expected structure
  return { id: userId, ...userData };
}
```

## Green Phase Checklist

Before moving to Refactor phase, ensure:

- [ ] **All tests passing** - No failing tests remain
- [ ] **No regressions** - Previously passing tests still pass
- [ ] **Minimal implementation** - Only code needed for tests
- [ ] **Clear test traceability** - Implementation addresses specific tests
- [ ] **No feature creep** - No functionality without tests
- [ ] **Basic quality standards** - Code is readable and correct
- [ ] **Frequent commits** - Changes committed with test references
- [ ] **Story metadata updated** - TDD status set to 'green'

## Success Indicators

**You know you're succeeding in Green phase when:**

1. **All tests consistently pass**
2. **Implementation is obviously minimal**
3. **Each code block addresses specific test requirements**
4. **No functionality exists without corresponding tests**
5. **Tests run quickly and reliably**
6. **Code changes are small and focused**

**Green phase is complete when:**

- Zero failing tests
- Implementation covers all test scenarios
- Code is minimal but correct
- Ready for refactoring improvements

Remember: Green phase is about making it work, not making it perfect. Resist the urge to optimize or add features - that comes in the Refactor phase!

# TDD Refactor Phase Prompts

Instructions for Dev and QA agents when refactoring code while maintaining green tests in Test-Driven Development.

## Core Refactor Phase Mindset

**You are in TDD REFACTOR PHASE. Your mission is to improve code quality while keeping ALL tests green. Every change must preserve existing behavior.**

### Primary Objectives

1. **Preserve behavior** - External behavior must remain exactly the same
2. **Improve design** - Make code more readable, maintainable, and extensible
3. **Eliminate technical debt** - Remove duplication, improve naming, fix code smells
4. **Maintain test coverage** - All tests must stay green throughout
5. **Small steps** - Make incremental improvements with frequent test runs

## Refactoring Safety Rules

### The Golden Rule

**NEVER proceed with a refactoring step if tests are red.** Always revert and try smaller changes.

### Safe Refactoring Workflow

```yaml
refactoring_cycle:
  1. identify_smell: 'Find specific code smell to address'
  2. plan_change: 'Decide on minimal improvement step'
  3. run_tests: 'Ensure all tests are green before starting'
  4. make_change: 'Apply single, small refactoring'
  5. run_tests: 'Verify tests are still green'
  6. commit: 'Save progress if tests pass'
  7. repeat: 'Move to next improvement'

abort_conditions:
  - tests_turn_red: 'Immediately revert and try smaller step'
  - behavior_changes: 'Revert if external interface changes'
  - complexity_increases: 'Revert if code becomes harder to understand'
```

## Code Smells and Refactoring Techniques

### Duplication Elimination

**Before: Repeated validation logic**

```javascript
function createUser(data) {
  if (!data.email.includes('@')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email format');
  }
  return { id: generateId(), ...data };
}

function updateUser(id, data) {
  if (!data.email.includes('@')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email format');
  }
  return { id, ...data };
}
```

**After: Extract validation function**

```javascript
function validateEmail(email) {
  if (!email.includes('@')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email format');
  }
}

function createUser(data) {
  validateEmail(data.email);
  return { id: generateId(), ...data };
}

function updateUser(id, data) {
  validateEmail(data.email);
  return { id, ...data };
}
```

### Long Method Refactoring

**Before: Method doing too much**

```javascript
function processUserRegistration(userData) {
  // Validation (5 lines)
  if (!userData.email.includes('@')) throw new Error('Invalid email');
  if (!userData.name || userData.name.trim().length === 0) throw new Error('Name required');
  if (userData.age < 18) throw new Error('Must be 18 or older');

  // Data transformation (4 lines)
  const user = {
    id: generateId(),
    email: userData.email.toLowerCase(),
    name: userData.name.trim(),
    age: userData.age,
  };

  // Business logic (3 lines)
  if (userData.age >= 65) {
    user.discountEligible = true;
  }

  return user;
}
```

**After: Extract methods**

```javascript
function validateUserData(userData) {
  if (!userData.email.includes('@')) throw new Error('Invalid email');
  if (!userData.name || userData.name.trim().length === 0) throw new Error('Name required');
  if (userData.age < 18) throw new Error('Must be 18 or older');
}

function normalizeUserData(userData) {
  return {
    id: generateId(),
    email: userData.email.toLowerCase(),
    name: userData.name.trim(),
    age: userData.age,
  };
}

function applyBusinessRules(user) {
  if (user.age >= 65) {
    user.discountEligible = true;
  }
  return user;
}

function processUserRegistration(userData) {
  validateUserData(userData);
  const user = normalizeUserData(userData);
  return applyBusinessRules(user);
}
```

### Magic Numbers and Constants

**Before: Magic numbers scattered**

```javascript
function calculateShipping(weight) {
  if (weight < 5) {
    return 4.99;
  } else if (weight < 20) {
    return 9.99;
  } else {
    return 19.99;
  }
}
```

**After: Named constants**

```javascript
const SHIPPING_RATES = {
  LIGHT_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD: 5,
  MEDIUM_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD: 20,
  LIGHT_SHIPPING_COST: 4.99,
  MEDIUM_SHIPPING_COST: 9.99,
  HEAVY_SHIPPING_COST: 19.99,
};

function calculateShipping(weight) {
  if (weight < SHIPPING_RATES.LIGHT_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD) {
    return SHIPPING_RATES.LIGHT_SHIPPING_COST;
  } else if (weight < SHIPPING_RATES.MEDIUM_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD) {
    return SHIPPING_RATES.MEDIUM_SHIPPING_COST;
  } else {
    return SHIPPING_RATES.HEAVY_SHIPPING_COST;
  }
}
```

### Variable Naming Improvements

**Before: Unclear names**

```javascript
function calc(u, p) {
  const t = u * p;
  const d = t * 0.1;
  return t - d;
}
```

**After: Intention-revealing names**

```javascript
function calculateNetPrice(unitPrice, quantity) {
  const totalPrice = unitPrice * quantity;
  const discount = totalPrice * 0.1;
  return totalPrice - discount;
}
```

## Refactoring Strategies by Code Smell

### Complex Conditionals

**Before: Nested conditions**

```javascript
function determineUserType(user) {
  if (user.age >= 18) {
    if (user.hasAccount) {
      if (user.isPremium) {
        return 'premium-member';
      } else {
        return 'basic-member';
      }
    } else {
      return 'guest-adult';
    }
  } else {
    return 'minor';
  }
}
```

**After: Guard clauses and early returns**

```javascript
function determineUserType(user) {
  if (user.age < 18) {
    return 'minor';
  }

  if (!user.hasAccount) {
    return 'guest-adult';
  }

  return user.isPremium ? 'premium-member' : 'basic-member';
}
```

### Large Classes (God Object)

**Before: Class doing too much**

```javascript
class UserManager {
  validateUser(data) {
    /* validation logic */
  }
  createUser(data) {
    /* creation logic */
  }
  sendWelcomeEmail(user) {
    /* email logic */
  }
  logUserActivity(user, action) {
    /* logging logic */
  }
  calculateUserStats(user) {
    /* analytics logic */
  }
}
```

**After: Single responsibility classes**

```javascript
class UserValidator {
  validate(data) {
    /* validation logic */
  }
}

class UserService {
  create(data) {
    /* creation logic */
  }
}

class EmailService {
  sendWelcome(user) {
    /* email logic */
  }
}

class ActivityLogger {
  log(user, action) {
    /* logging logic */
  }
}

class UserAnalytics {
  calculateStats(user) {
    /* analytics logic */
  }
}
```

## Collaborative Refactoring (Dev + QA)

### When to Involve QA Agent

**QA Agent should participate when:**

```yaml
qa_involvement_triggers:
  test_modification_needed:
    - 'Test expectations need updating'
    - 'New test cases discovered during refactoring'
    - 'Mock strategies need adjustment'

  coverage_assessment:
    - 'Refactoring exposes untested code paths'
    - 'New methods need test coverage'
    - 'Test organization needs improvement'

  design_validation:
    - 'Interface changes affect test structure'
    - 'Mocking strategy becomes complex'
    - 'Test maintainability concerns'
```

### Dev-QA Collaboration Workflow

```yaml
collaborative_steps:
  1. dev_identifies_refactoring: 'Dev spots code smell'
  2. assess_test_impact: 'Both agents review test implications'
  3. plan_refactoring: 'Agree on approach and steps'
  4. dev_refactors: 'Dev makes incremental changes'
  5. qa_validates_tests: 'QA ensures tests remain valid'
  6. both_review: 'Joint review of improved code and tests'
```

## Advanced Refactoring Patterns

### Extract Interface for Testability

**Before: Hard to test due to dependencies**

```javascript
class OrderService {
  constructor() {
    this.emailSender = new EmailSender();
    this.paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor();
  }

  processOrder(order) {
    const result = this.paymentProcessor.charge(order.total);
    this.emailSender.sendConfirmation(order.customerEmail);
    return result;
  }
}
```

**After: Dependency injection for testability**

```javascript
class OrderService {
  constructor(emailSender, paymentProcessor) {
    this.emailSender = emailSender;
    this.paymentProcessor = paymentProcessor;
  }

  processOrder(order) {
    const result = this.paymentProcessor.charge(order.total);
    this.emailSender.sendConfirmation(order.customerEmail);
    return result;
  }
}

// Usage in production:
const orderService = new OrderService(new EmailSender(), new PaymentProcessor());

// Usage in tests:
const mockEmail = { sendConfirmation: jest.fn() };
const mockPayment = { charge: jest.fn().mockReturnValue('success') };
const orderService = new OrderService(mockEmail, mockPayment);
```

### Replace Conditional with Polymorphism

**Before: Switch statement**

```javascript
function calculateArea(shape) {
  switch (shape.type) {
    case 'circle':
      return Math.PI * shape.radius * shape.radius;
    case 'rectangle':
      return shape.width * shape.height;
    case 'triangle':
      return 0.5 * shape.base * shape.height;
    default:
      throw new Error('Unknown shape type');
  }
}
```

**After: Polymorphic classes**

```javascript
class Circle {
  constructor(radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  calculateArea() {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  }
}

class Rectangle {
  constructor(width, height) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }

  calculateArea() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

class Triangle {
  constructor(base, height) {
    this.base = base;
    this.height = height;
  }

  calculateArea() {
    return 0.5 * this.base * this.height;
  }
}
```

## Refactoring Safety Checks

### Before Each Refactoring Step

```bash
# 1. Ensure all tests are green
npm test
pytest
go test ./...

# 2. Consider impact
# - Will this change external interfaces?
# - Are there hidden dependencies?
# - Could this affect performance significantly?

# 3. Plan the smallest possible step
# - What's the minimal change that improves code?
# - Can this be broken into smaller steps?
```

### After Each Refactoring Step

```bash
# 1. Run tests immediately
npm test

# 2. If tests fail:
git checkout -- .  # Revert changes
# Plan smaller refactoring step

# 3. If tests pass:
git add .
git commit -m "REFACTOR: Extract validateEmail function [maintains UC-001, UC-002]"
```

## Refactoring Anti-Patterns

### Don't Change Behavior

```javascript
// Wrong: Changing logic during refactoring
function calculateDiscount(amount) {
  // Original: 10% discount
  return amount * 0.1;

  // Refactored: DON'T change the discount rate
  return amount * 0.15; // This changes behavior!
}

// Right: Only improve structure
const DISCOUNT_RATE = 0.1; // Extract constant
function calculateDiscount(amount) {
  return amount * DISCOUNT_RATE; // Same behavior
}
```

### Don't Add Features

```javascript
// Wrong: Adding features during refactoring
function validateUser(userData) {
  validateEmail(userData.email); // Existing
  validateName(userData.name); // Existing
  validateAge(userData.age); // DON'T add new validation
}

// Right: Only improve existing code
function validateUser(userData) {
  validateEmail(userData.email);
  validateName(userData.name);
  // Age validation needs its own failing test first
}
```

### Don't Make Large Changes

```javascript
// Wrong: Massive refactoring in one step
class UserService {
  // Completely rewrite entire class structure
}

// Right: Small, incremental improvements
class UserService {
  // Extract one method at a time
  // Rename one variable at a time
  // Improve one code smell at a time
}
```

## Refactor Phase Checklist

Before considering refactoring complete:

- [ ] **All tests remain green** - No test failures introduced
- [ ] **Code quality improved** - Measurable improvement in readability/maintainability
- [ ] **No behavior changes** - External behavior is identical
- [ ] **Technical debt reduced** - Specific code smells addressed
- [ ] **Small commits made** - Each improvement committed separately
- [ ] **Documentation updated** - Comments and docs reflect changes
- [ ] **Performance maintained** - No significant performance degradation
- [ ] **Story metadata updated** - Refactoring notes and improvements documented

## Success Indicators

**Refactoring is successful when:**

1. **All tests consistently pass** throughout the process
2. **Code is noticeably easier to read** and understand
3. **Duplication has been eliminated** or significantly reduced
4. **Method/class sizes are more reasonable** (functions < 15 lines)
5. **Variable and function names clearly express intent**
6. **Code complexity has decreased** (fewer nested conditions)
7. **Future changes will be easier** due to better structure

**Refactoring is complete when:**

- No obvious code smells remain in the story scope
- Code quality metrics show improvement
- Tests provide comprehensive safety net
- Ready for next TDD cycle or story completion

Remember: Refactoring is about improving design, not adding features. Keep tests green, make small changes, and focus on making the code better for the next developer!
