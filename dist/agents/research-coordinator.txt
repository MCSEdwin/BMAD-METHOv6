# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-core/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-core/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-core/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-core/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# Search Research Log Task

## Purpose

This task enables the Research Coordinator to search existing research logs to identify prior related work and prevent duplicate research efforts.

## Process

### 1. Search Strategy

#### Check Research Index

1. **Load Research Index**: Read `docs/research/research-index.md`
2. **Keyword Search**: Search for related terms in:
   - Research titles and descriptions
   - Domain tags and categories
   - Key insights summaries
   - Requesting agent information

#### Search Parameters

- **Topic Keywords**: Core subject terms from research request
- **Domain Tags**: Technical, market, user, competitive, etc.
- **Date Range**: Recent research vs historical
- **Requesting Agent**: Previous requests from same agent

### 2. Analysis Process

#### Evaluate Matches

For each potential match:

1. **Relevance Assessment**
   - How closely does it match current request?
   - What aspects are covered vs missing?
   - Is the perspective angle similar or different?

2. **Currency Evaluation**
   - When was the research conducted?
   - Is the information still current and relevant?
   - Have market/technical conditions changed significantly?

3. **Quality Review**
   - What was the depth and scope of prior research?
   - Quality of sources and analysis
   - Confidence levels in findings

### 3. Output Options

#### Full Coverage Exists

- **Recommendation**: Refer to existing research
- **Action**: Provide link and summary of relevant findings
- **Update Strategy**: Consider if refresh needed due to age

#### Partial Coverage Available

- **Recommendation**: Build on existing research
- **Action**: Identify specific gaps to focus new research
- **Integration Strategy**: How to combine old and new findings

#### No Relevant Coverage
