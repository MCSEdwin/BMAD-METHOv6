## Safety Command Templates

### Read-Only Analysis (Safest)

```bash
gemini --approval-mode default "@{paths} {prompt}"
```

### Auto-Edit Mode (Edit files automatically)

```bash
gemini --approval-mode auto_edit "@{paths} {prompt}"
```

### Sandbox Mode (Safe environment)

```bash
gemini --sandbox "@{paths} {prompt}"
```

## Command Construction Patterns

### Path Validation

- Always validate paths exist before construction
- Use relative paths from current working directory
- Include trailing slash for directories: `@src/`
- Specific files without slash: `@package.json`

### Prompt Construction

- Be specific about what you want analyzed
- Include context about the codebase/project type
- Specify output format if needed (list, summary, detailed)
- Ask for file paths in responses for follow-up

### Common Path Combinations

- **Full Stack**: `@src/ @api/ @database/ @config/`
- **Frontend Only**: `@src/ @public/ @package.json`
- **Backend Only**: `@api/ @services/ @models/ @config/`
- **Testing Focus**: `@src/ @tests/ @__tests__/ @cypress/`
- **Documentation**: `@docs/ @README.md @CHANGELOG.md`
