# Search Research Log Task

## Purpose

This task enables the Research Coordinator to search existing research logs to identify prior related work and prevent duplicate research efforts.

## Process

### 1. Search Strategy

#### Check Research Index

1. **Load Research Index**: Read `docs/research/research-index.md`
2. **Keyword Search**: Search for related terms in:
   - Research titles and descriptions
   - Domain tags and categories
   - Key insights summaries
   - Requesting agent information

#### Search Parameters

- **Topic Keywords**: Core subject terms from research request
- **Domain Tags**: Technical, market, user, competitive, etc.
- **Date Range**: Recent research vs historical
- **Requesting Agent**: Previous requests from same agent

### 2. Analysis Process

#### Evaluate Matches

For each potential match:

1. **Relevance Assessment**
   - How closely does it match current request?
   - What aspects are covered vs missing?
   - Is the perspective angle similar or different?

2. **Currency Evaluation**
   - When was the research conducted?
   - Is the information still current and relevant?
   - Have market/technical conditions changed significantly?

3. **Quality Review**
   - What was the depth and scope of prior research?
   - Quality of sources and analysis
   - Confidence levels in findings

### 3. Output Options

#### Full Coverage Exists

- **Recommendation**: Refer to existing research
- **Action**: Provide link and summary of relevant findings
- **Update Strategy**: Consider if refresh needed due to age

#### Partial Coverage Available

- **Recommendation**: Build on existing research
- **Action**: Identify specific gaps to focus new research
- **Integration Strategy**: How to combine old and new findings

#### No Relevant Coverage

- **Recommendation**: Proceed with full research effort
- **Action**: Document search results to avoid future confusion
- **Baseline**: Use existing research as context background

#### Outdated Coverage

- **Recommendation**: Update/refresh existing research
- **Action**: Compare current request to prior research scope
- **Strategy**: Full refresh vs targeted updates

### 4. Documentation

#### Search Results Summary

```markdown
## Research Log Search Results

**Search Terms**: [keywords used]
**Date Range**: [search period]
**Matches Found**: [number of potential matches]

### Relevant Prior Research

1. **[Research Title]** (Date: YYYY-MM-DD)
   - **Relevance**: [how closely it matches]
   - **Coverage**: [what aspects are covered]
   - **Currency**: [how recent/relevant]
   - **Quality**: [assessment of depth/sources]
   - **Recommendation**: [use as-is/build-on/refresh/ignore]

### Search Conclusion

- **Overall Assessment**: [full/partial/no/outdated coverage]
- **Recommended Action**: [refer/build-on/proceed/refresh]
- **Integration Strategy**: [how to use prior work]
```

### 5. Integration Recommendations

#### Building on Prior Research

- **Reference Strategy**: How to cite and build upon existing work
- **Gap Focus**: Specific areas to concentrate new research efforts
- **Perspective Additions**: New angles not covered in prior research
- **Update Requirements**: Refresh outdated information

#### Avoiding Duplication

- **Scope Differentiation**: How current request differs from prior work
- **Methodology Variation**: Different research approaches to try
- **Source Expansion**: New information sources to explore
- **Analysis Enhancement**: Deeper or alternative analytical frameworks

## Integration with Research Workflow

This task is typically called at the beginning of the research coordination process to inform strategy and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort.
