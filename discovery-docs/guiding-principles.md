# 1 - BMAD Growth Marketing Guiding Principles

This document outlines the core philosophies and practical guidelines for using and extending the BMAD Growth Marketing Expansion Pack.

## 2 - Core Principles

These are the foundational beliefs that shape the strategic approach of this expansion pack.

### 3 - 1. We are Architects, Not Just Builders.
* **Why**: The most common failure in marketing is executing flawless tactics against a flawed strategy. True, sustainable growth is not accidental; it is architected.
* **How**: We embody this principle by leading with a "thinker-first" agent structure. Before a single piece of content is created or a campaign is launched, agents like the `growth-strategist` and `brand-strategist` are deployed to build a strategic blueprint using foundational frameworks.

### 3 - 2. We Build Systems, Not Just Campaigns.
* **Why**: A successful campaign produces a temporary lift; a successful system produces perpetual growth. Relying on isolated marketing efforts is a trap that limits scale and makes success impossible to replicate.
* **How**: This principle is the core of the Expansion Pack's design as a "marketing operating system". We create repeatable, scalable growth through structured workflows that connect specialized agents, turning marketing into a predictable and manageable function.

### 3 - 3. The Funnel is a Flywheel, Not a Pipeline.
* **Why**: The traditional linear funnel is a transactional model that ignores the immense growth potential of a happy, engaged customer base. A flywheel is a self-sustaining model where delighted customers become your most powerful marketing channel.
* **How**: We reject the linear funnel in favor of the **Flywheel Model (Attract, Engage, Delight)**. Our agent collective is built to manage this entire lifecycle, with agents like the `community-manager` dedicated to delighting users and turning them into advocates.

### 3 - 4. Data is Our Compass, Not Our Destination.
* **Why**: The goal of data is not to produce reports; it is to produce better decisions. Data's true purpose is to provide clear, actionable direction on the path to growth.
* **How**: We implement this principle by pairing a dedicated `data-analyst` with goal-oriented frameworks like **AARRR (Pirate Metrics)** and **HEART**. This ensures that data is always a tool for strategic navigation, guiding the entire collective toward measurable business outcomes.

### 3 - 5. We Are Conductors of an AI Orchestra, Not Soloists.
* **Why**: The power of AI is not in any single agent, but in the orchestration of many specialists. The human user's highest leverage is not in doing the work, but in conducting the orchestra.
* **How**: The user acts as the "Growth Strategist," providing the vision and strategic intent. The `project-manager` agent translates that vision into a coordinated plan for the entire ensemble of specialized "thinker," "maker," and "doer" agents, creating a powerful human-AI partnership.

## 2 - Practical Guidelines

These are the rules for designing and using the components of the Growth Marketing Expansion Pack.

### 3 - Agent Design Rules
* **Specialize by Team**: Every agent persona must belong to one of the five core teams (e.g., Growth Intelligence, Product Experience) to ensure clear lines of responsibility.
* **Categorize by Function**: Each agent should be categorized as a "Thinker" (strategy/analysis), "Maker" (creation), or "Doer" (implementation/optimization) to clarify their role in the workflow.
* **Promote Lean Operations**: Consolidate responsibilities into multi-functional personas to maintain an agile and efficient collective.

### 3 - Task Writing Rules
* **Be Atomic**: Each task must represent a single, granular action (e.g., `generate-ad-headlines`) that can be easily chained into larger workflows.
* **Define Inputs & Outputs**: Every task must have clearly defined inputs (what it needs to run) and outputs (what it produces).
* **Use Command-like Naming**: Task names should be verb-based to clearly communicate their action (e.g., `analyze-competitors`).

### 3 - Template Rules
* **Represent Key Deliverables**: Templates should correspond to the major, repeatable strategic documents and assets of the marketing process (e.g., `Quarterly Growth Strategy & Campaign Roadmap`).
* **Assign to a Primary Agent**: Each template must be owned by a primary agent team responsible for its generation and quality.

## 2 - Remember

The goal of these principles is to provide a systematic, strategic, and scalable approach to marketing. By adhering to them, you transform marketing from a series of disconnected tactics into a cohesive growth engine.
