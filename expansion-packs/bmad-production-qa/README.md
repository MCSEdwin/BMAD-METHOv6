## 🔄 Enhanced Development Workflow

### Traditional BMAD Flow
```
Planning → SM creates story → Dev implements → QA reviews → Done
```

### Enhanced Production QA Flow
```
Planning → Test Strategy → SM creates story with QA →
         ↓
Dev implements ←→ QA creates test suites (parallel)
         ↓
Execute tests → Quality gates → Production ready
```

## 📊 Quality Gates

Stories must pass all quality gates before production deployment:

### Automated Gates
- ✅ Unit test coverage ≥ 80%
- ✅ All E2E tests pass
- ✅ API tests pass with proper error handling
- ✅ Performance meets defined SLAs
- ✅ Security scans show no critical vulnerabilities
- ✅ Accessibility standards met (if applicable)

### Manual Gates (Optional)
- 🔍 Security review for sensitive features
- 🔍 Performance validation for critical paths
- 🔍 UX review for user-facing changes

## 🛠️ Tool Support (Framework Agnostic)

## 🔄 Automated Sync with Upstream BMAD

This fork automatically syncs with upstream BMAD weekly:

- **Automatic sync** every Sunday
- **Preserves QA integration** during updates
- **Creates PR** for review when changes detected
- **Handles conflicts** gracefully with notifications

### Manual Sync
```bash
# Trigger manual sync
gh workflow run "Sync with Upstream BMAD and Re-apply QA Integration"

# Or locally
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
# QA integration preserved automatically
```

## 📖 Example Usage

### Creating a Story with QA Integration
```bash
@sm *draft
```
**Result**: Story created with comprehensive testing requirements including:
- E2E user journey scenarios
- API endpoint validation requirements
- Performance criteria
- Security considerations
- Accessibility requirements

### Implementing Tests
```bash
@qa-test-engineer *create-e2e-tests docs/stories/1.1.user-login.story.md
```
**Result**:
- Asks for your preferred framework (Playwright, Cypress, etc.)
- Generates complete test suite based on story requirements
- Creates test data and fixtures
- Provides execution instructions

## 🎓 Best Practices

### Story Creation
1. Always use `@sm *draft` for QA-integrated stories
2. Review testing requirements before development
3. Ensure acceptance criteria cover testable outcomes

### Test Development
1. Create tests in parallel with development
2. Start with happy path scenarios
3. Add edge cases and error handling
4. Maintain test data separately from test logic

### Quality Gates
1. Run tests locally before commits
2. Fix failing tests immediately
3. Maintain test coverage above thresholds
4. Review performance impacts regularly

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tests not generating**
- Ensure story file exists and has proper AC
- Check that testing framework is selected
- Verify expansion pack is properly loaded

**Quality gates failing**
- Check test execution logs in test-reports/
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Verify test environments are accessible

**Sync issues with upstream**
- Check .github/workflows/sync-upstream-bmad.yml
- Resolve any merge conflicts manually
- Contact maintainers if automation fails
