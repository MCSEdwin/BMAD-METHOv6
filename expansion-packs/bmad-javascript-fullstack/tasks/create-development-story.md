# Create Development Story Task

## Purpose
Create detailed, actionable development stories for JavaScript/TypeScript full-stack features that enable developers to implement without additional design decisions.

## When to Use
- Breaking down epics into implementable stories
- Converting architecture documents into development tasks
- Preparing work for sprint planning
- Ensuring clear handoffs from design to development

## Prerequisites
Before creating stories, ensure you have:
- Completed architecture document
- PRD or feature requirements
- Epic definition this story belongs to
- Clear understanding of the specific feature

## Process

### 1. Story Identification
**Review Context:**
- Understand the epic's overall goal
- Review architecture document sections
- Identify specific feature to implement
- Verify no duplicate work

**Feature Analysis:**
- Reference specific requirements
- Understand user experience goals
- Identify technical complexity
- Estimate implementation scope (1-3 days ideal)

### 2. Story Scoping
**Single Responsibility:**
- Focus on one specific feature or component
- Ensure story is completable in 1-3 days
- Break down complex features into multiple stories
- Maintain clear boundaries with other stories

**Implementation Clarity:**
- Define exactly what needs to be built
- Specify all technical requirements
- Include all necessary integration points
- Provide clear success criteria

### 3. Template Execution
**Use Template:**
Use `templates/stories/javascript-development-story.md` template

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Clear, actionable description with user story format
- Specific acceptance criteria (functional, technical, security)
- Detailed technical specifications
- Complete implementation task list
- Comprehensive testing requirements
- Type definitions and interfaces

### 4. Story Validation
**Technical Review:**
- Verify all technical specifications are complete
- Ensure integration points are clearly defined
- Confirm file paths and structure
- Validate TypeScript interfaces

**Architecture Alignment:**
- Confirm story implements architecture requirements
- Verify technology choices match architecture doc
- Check database changes align with schema
- Ensure API contracts are consistent

**Implementation Readiness:**
- All dependencies identified and listed
- Asset requirements specified if needed
- Testing criteria defined
- Definition of Done complete

### 5. Quality Assurance
**Apply Checklist:**
Execute `checklists/story-dod-checklist.md` against completed story

**Story Criteria:**
- Story is immediately actionable
- No design decisions left to developer
- Technical requirements are complete
- Testing requirements are comprehensive
- Security requirements specified

### 6. Story Refinement
**Developer Perspective:**
- Can a developer start implementation immediately?
- Are all technical questions answered?
- Is the scope appropriate for the estimated points?
- Are all dependencies clearly identified?

**Iterative Improvement:**
- Address any gaps or ambiguities
- Clarify complex technical requirements
- Ensure story fits within epic scope
- Verify story points estimation (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)

## Story Elements Checklist

### Required Sections
- [ ] Clear user story (As a, I want, So that)
- [ ] Complete acceptance criteria (functional, technical)
- [ ] Detailed technical specifications
- [ ] File creation/modification list
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces and types
- [ ] Integration point specifications
- [ ] Ordered implementation tasks
- [ ] Comprehensive testing requirements
- [ ] Performance criteria
- [ ] Security considerations
- [ ] Dependencies clearly identified
- [ ] Definition of Done checklist

### Full-Stack Considerations
- [ ] Frontend changes (if applicable)
- [ ] Backend changes (if applicable)
- [ ] API contract (if applicable)
- [ ] Database migrations (if applicable)
- [ ] Both client and server validation
- [ ] Error handling on both layers
- [ ] Loading states and user feedback

### Technical Quality
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Architecture document alignment
- [ ] Code organization follows standards
- [ ] Error handling requirements
- [ ] Logging requirements
- [ ] Testing strategy defined

## Common Pitfalls

**Scope Issues:**
- Story too large (break into multiple stories - 1-3 days max)
- Story too vague (add specific requirements)
- Missing dependencies (identify all prerequisites)
- Unclear boundaries (define what's in/out of scope)

**Technical Issues:**
- Missing integration details (API contracts, events)
- Incomplete technical specifications
- Undefined TypeScript interfaces
- Missing performance requirements
- No error handling specified

**Full-Stack Coordination:**
- Frontend and backend changes not aligned
- API contract not defined
- Database changes not included
- Missing validation on both layers

## Success Criteria

**Story Readiness:**
- [ ] Developer can start implementation immediately
- [ ] No additional design decisions required
- [ ] All technical questions answered
- [ ] Testing strategy is complete
- [ ] Performance requirements are clear
- [ ] Security requirements specified
- [ ] Story fits within epic scope
- [ ] Estimated effort realistic (1-3 days)

**Quality Validation:**
- [ ] Story DOD checklist passes
- [ ] Architecture alignment confirmed
- [ ] Requirements covered
- [ ] Implementation tasks are ordered and specific
- [ ] Dependencies are complete and accurate

## Handoff Protocol

**To Developer:**
1. Provide story document
2. Confirm access to architecture docs and requirements
3. Verify all dependencies are met
4. Answer any clarification questions
5. Establish check-in schedule

**Story Status Updates:**
- To Do → In Development
- In Development → Code Review
- Code Review → QA Testing
- QA Testing → Done

## Story Template Sections

**Header:**
- Story ID, Epic, Sprint, Assignee, Status, Priority, Effort

**Description:**
- User story format
- Background and context
- Goals

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Functional requirements (user-facing)
- Technical requirements (code quality)
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements

**Technical Specification:**
- Frontend implementation (components, hooks, state)
- Backend implementation (endpoints, services, database)
- TypeScript types and interfaces
- Integration points

**Testing:**
- Unit tests required
- Integration tests required
- E2E tests if critical flow
- Manual testing checklist

**Dependencies:**
- Blocked by (must complete first)
- Blocks (what depends on this)
- Related stories

This task ensures development stories are comprehensive, actionable, and enable efficient implementation of full-stack JavaScript features.
