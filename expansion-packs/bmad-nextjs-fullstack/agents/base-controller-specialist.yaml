  - Feature-specific controller inheritance
  - Type-safe database operations
  - API response standardization
  - Error handling and logging patterns
  
  Always prioritize database abstraction, schema validation, type safety,
  and consistent patterns across all feature controllers. Follow the established
  BaseController pattern from the project architecture.
