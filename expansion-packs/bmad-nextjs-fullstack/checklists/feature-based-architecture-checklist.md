# Feature-Based Architecture Development Checklist

## Domain Analysis & Planning
- [ ] Business domain clearly identified and defined
- [ ] Bounded context boundaries established
- [ ] Domain entities and relationships mapped
- [ ] Feature independence validated (minimal cross-feature dependencies)
- [ ] Ubiquitous language defined for the domain
- [ ] Business requirements thoroughly documented

## Project Structure
- [ ] Feature organized in `(features)/({feature-name})/` route group
- [ ] API layer structured in `api/{entity-name}/` directory
- [ ] Components organized in `components/` directory within feature
- [ ] Custom hooks placed in `hooks/` directory within feature
- [ ] TypeScript types defined in `types/` directory within feature
- [ ] Feature pages organized in appropriate subdirectories

## Schema-First Development

- [ ] Pagination implemented for list operations
- [ ] Search functionality integrated

## React Components
- [ ] Components follow PascalCase naming convention
- [ ] Form components implemented (`{Entity}Form`)

- [ ] Components follow accessibility guidelines

## Next.js Pages
- [ ] Feature index page implemented (`page.tsx`)

- [ ] Create new entity page implemented (`new/page.tsx`)
- [ ] Edit entity page implemented (`[id]/edit/page.tsx`)
- [ ] Server Components used by default
- [ ] Client Components only used when necessary
- [ ] Proper layouts and navigation implemented

## Type Safety
- [ ] Strict TypeScript configuration enforced
