  description: Agile workflow for adding new features to existing JavaScript/TypeScript applications. Story-driven development from requirement to deployment.
  type: feature-addition
  project_types:
    - existing-application
    - continuous-delivery
    - agile-sprint

  sequence:
    - agent: analyst
      creates: feature-requirements.md
      notes: "Document feature requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, and success metrics. SAVE to docs/features/[feature-name]/"

    - agent: js-solution-architect
      reviews: technical_impact
      requires: feature-requirements.md
      notes: Assess technical impact on existing architecture. Identify affected components, database changes, API modifications, and integration points.

    - agent: react-developer OR node-backend-developer OR api-developer
      creates: technical-specification.md
      requires:
        - feature-requirements.md
        - technical_impact_review
      notes: "Create detailed technical spec with file changes, new components/endpoints, types, tests, and implementation steps. SAVE to docs/features/[feature-name]/"

    - agent: scrum-master
      creates: feature-stories.md
      requires: technical-specification.md
      uses: create-development-story task
      notes: Break feature into implementable stories with clear acceptance criteria and DoD.

  workflow_end:
    action: begin_feature_implementation
    notes: Feature fully specified and broken into stories. Developers can begin implementation following story sequence.

  story_flow:
    - Create feature branch from main
    - Implement stories in sequence
    - Write tests for each story
    - Code review before merging
    - Deploy to staging for QA
    - Merge to main and deploy to production

  best_practices:
    - Keep feature branches short-lived (< 3 days)
    - Deploy incrementally with feature flags
    - Write tests before code (TDD)
    - Update documentation with code changes
    - Monitor metrics post-deployment
