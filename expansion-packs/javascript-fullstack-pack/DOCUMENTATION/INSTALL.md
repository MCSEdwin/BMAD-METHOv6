## 📖 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Read the Documentation (5-10 minutes)

Start with **one** of these based on your needs:

- **Quick start?** → `QUICKSTART.md`
- **Complete overview?** → `README.md`
- **Find specific info?** → `INDEX.md`
- **Executive summary?** → `SUMMARY.md`

### Step 2: Explore the Agents (30-60 minutes)

Review the agent that matches your immediate need:

- **Planning a project?** → `agents/js-solution-architect.md`
- **Building UI?** → `agents/react-developer.md`
- **Creating APIs?** → `agents/node-backend-developer.md`
- **Designing endpoints?** → `agents/api-developer.md`
- **TypeScript issues?** → `agents/typescript-expert.md`

### Step 3: Try It Out (1-2 hours)

Pick a small project and:
1. Use the **JS Solution Architect** to design it
2. Use the **PRD template** to document it
3. Use the **Story template** to break it down
4. Implement with **React** and **Node** developers

### Step 4: Build Something Real (1-2 days)

Follow the complete workflow in `QUICKSTART.md` to build a real application.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Getting the Most Value

1. **Don't read everything at once**
   - Start with QUICKSTART.md
   - Deep dive into agents as you need them
   
2. **Use the right agent for the job**
   - Architecture decisions → Solution Architect
   - Frontend code → React Developer
   - Backend code → Node Backend Developer
   - API design → API Developer
   - Type problems → TypeScript Expert

3. **Follow the templates**
   - Use PRD template for requirements
   - Use Story template for tasks
   - They ensure you don't miss important details

4. **Iterate and refine**
   - Start with high-level architecture
   - Break down into stories
   - Implement incrementally
   - Refine based on feedback

5. **Keep conversations focused**
   - One topic per agent conversation
   - Provide context upfront
   - Reference previous decisions when needed

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Skipping architecture planning** → Always start with Solution Architect
❌ **Using wrong agent** → Check agent specializations first
❌ **Not providing context** → Share project details and constraints
❌ **Ignoring templates** → They capture best practices
❌ **Reading everything** → Start with quick start, dive deeper as needed

## 🔧 Customization

### Modifying Agents

Each agent file can be customized:
1. Open the agent `.md` file
2. Modify the expertise, examples, or patterns
3. Save and reload in BMAD
4. Test with your use cases

### Creating New Templates

Use existing templates as starting points:
1. Copy a template file
2. Modify sections for your needs
3. Save in `templates/` directory
4. Reference in your workflow

### Adding New Agents

Follow the pattern in existing agents:
1. Create new `.md` file in `agents/`
2. Include YAML frontmatter with agent config
3. Document expertise and patterns
4. Add to `package.json` manifest
